# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is made to help Bootcamp students study the prework content. I built this project so that I can better understand how web applications work. This guide is an easy way to study the content provided in the bootcamp prework section. I learned 3 web development languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the implementation of git and GitHub for version control.
